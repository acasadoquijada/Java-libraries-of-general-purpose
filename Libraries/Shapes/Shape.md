Set of classes for painting shapes in Java
========================
by Alejandro Casado Quijada

##Description
Set of classes to paint figures with own attributes in java.

This is not possible with the implementation of the current interface shape.

To correct this we have created an abstract class from which other classes 
inherit representing the various figures will paint.

This is not possible with the implementation of the current interface shape.

See more details of this in: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Shape.html

##Current classes

* MyShape -> The parent class
